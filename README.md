- Menu SQL queries functional in the current version:
- CREATE - INSERT - UPDATE - DELETE - SELECT - SQL DUMP - ERD generation - FOREIGN KEY

User store instructions:

- user_store.enc_copy: it's an empty user store with the columns [username, password]

- take the copy of 'user_store.enc_copy' from main_module and rename it to 'user_store.enc'.

- Place 'user_store.enc' parallel to AuthenticationMechanism.py for the program to use.
